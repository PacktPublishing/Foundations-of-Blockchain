The dev server by default expects the node to run on http://localhost:3001

You can modify the config in `./config/index.js` file to point it to a blockchain node running on different port.

## Build Setup
 


``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
